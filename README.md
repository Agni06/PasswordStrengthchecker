# PasswordStrengthchecker

Project: Password Strength Checker

Description:
Developed a Java application for assessing the strength of passwords entered by users.

Key Contributions:

Designed and implemented the core password strength checking algorithm to evaluate the complexity of passwords based on various criteria such as length, character types, and uniqueness.
Utilized object-oriented programming principles to create modular and maintainable code, with classes for handling password validation and user interaction.
Implemented a console-based interface for user interaction, providing a simple and straightforward means for input and output.
Added error handling to gracefully manage invalid input and ensure the robustness of the application, preventing potential security vulnerabilities.
Conducted testing to validate the accuracy of password strength evaluations and verify the functionality of the application under various scenarios, including edge cases and malicious input.
Technologies/Concepts Used:

Java programming language
Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
Command-line interface (CLI) development
Error handling and validation
Security considerations in password management
